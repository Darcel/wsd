			<h2>About Us</h2>
			
			<p><strong>Mission Statement</strong></p>
			<p>At Highway to Heaven we believe in the infallibility of the Bible, 
			and it is founded on faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God.  The purpose 
			of the church is to teach the Gospel message of salvation, to nurture the 
			believer, to preserve sound doctrine and to serve others in the likeness of 
			Christ.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Vision Statement</strong></p>
			<p>Our vision is to have a church where souls may come and be delivered 
			from the clutches of Satan and be enriched and empowered by the word of God 
			that they too may become Disciples of Christ. To reach out to a dying society 
			and to compelle men to come into the fellowship of Christ as the scripture 
			states it in Luke 14:23 "And the Lord said unto the servant, Go out into the 
			highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled",
			for we know that Satan will not let them go, but with the authority of
			God's word, love, mercy and grace it shall be so. To be a community leader
			by way of prison ministry, missionary ministry, and evangelizing. The
			scripture state that we should be the head and not the tail. A lot may 
			think this scripture means MONEY ONLY but, I not only believe that it mean 
			in our finances but also in society for we are the light of the world.</p>
